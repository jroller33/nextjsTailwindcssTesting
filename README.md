# Testing TailwindCSS components with Next.js 

I'm using this repo to test different TailwindCSS component libraries (ex: `tw-elements`, `flowbite`, etc) when using them with Next.js. It's much easier to test them in a separate project, than to try immediately using them in a project you're already working on. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
Next.js can sometimes run into issues when used with certain packages, or the package itself can have issues with how Next.js works.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to contribute or use this repo to test your own Tailwind components üòÅ

## Components that don't work with Next.js:

`tw-elements`: I was able to get the DatePicker to work, but after hours of troubleshooting I still couldn't get the Carousel to work.
